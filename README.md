# Water Tank Problem Visualization

This project visualizes the "Water Tank Problem" using JavaScript and the ECharts library. The goal is to calculate and display the units of water retained between walls in a bar visualization format. This project includes two visualizations:
1. **Wall and Water Visualization** - Displays both walls and water retained between them.
2. **Only Water Visualization** - Displays only the water retained between walls.
